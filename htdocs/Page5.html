  <table>
	<tr>
		<td>Character:</td>
		<td>Fun fact about them:</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Albedo</td>
		<td>Albedo, referred to as the "Kredeprinz" means chalk prince.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Aloy</td>
		<td>Mathijs de Jonge, the game director of Horizon Zero Dawn, has stated in an interview that while creating the world of the game, they wanted a lead that was strong enough to match the harsh environments and the hostile, intimidating robots. For inspiration, they turned to Sarah Connor for the Terminator movies and Ripley from the Alien franchise.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Amber</td>
		<td>The way Amber received her Vision was touching. She became an Outrider to find out why her grandfather went missing. However, her mission turned up nothing. Amber's grandfather did not leave anything behind for her. One day, she was reading an ancient book of legends when she came across this phrase: "What you lacked was not wind, but courage. It is courage that has allowed you to become the first flying birds of this world." After realizing Amber should take her destiny into her own hands, her Vision attached to her hip began to glow. She was ready to spread her wings and fly.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Arataki Itto</td>
		<td>Despite his strong appearance, Arataki Itto actually has an unusual weakness. That is to say, Arataki Itto is allergic to beans (one of the only characters to have a known food allergy). As for the reason behind this oddly specific dietary restriction, there is an interesting cultural note in Japanese mythology. Traditionally, oni are said to be weak against beans, ranging from acting as an unpassable seal to a more severe item. This is the root for soybean-throwing practices during the holiday of Setsubun, in which the beans are thrown indoors in order to ward away oni. More than likely, this is also the reason that Arataki Itto is allergic to beans.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Barbara</td>
		<td>Barbara is popular enough to influence the people of Monsdadt, and talking to them reveals that she is obsessed with spicy products. In fact, Barbara is known for importing items with Jueyun peppers as ingredients from Liyue, and many of her fans in the city follow suit. In her dialogue, she will also offer the Traveler one of her spicy energy drinks as it apparently helps pep her up.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Beidou</td>
		<td>Not everyone in Liyue was born in the city and lived in luxury and Beidou's backstory proves it. Beidou actually grew up poor, and her family had trouble eating on some days. Her family was so poor that Beidou actually had to resort to stealing food in order to ensure that she could eat each day. This likely is the reason that Beidou took a different path from the rest of Liyue's citizens. She was treated badly by the merchants in Liyue, although they all now have great respect for the captain.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Bennet</td>
		<td> He was abandoned as a baby.Bennett doesn't know his biological parents, and there are no clues to who they are. He was found in a hazardous place in Teyvat and barely saved by an older adventurer. Strangely, the old man was the first adventure known to make it through the area, making Bennett's appearance even more stunning.Bennett himself is a mystery, and his origin is one that will pique the interest of those around him.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Chongyun</td>
		<td>Chongyun prefers Inazuma's dishes. Since Chongyun overheats whenever he gets too hot, he isn't able to eat any of Liyue's famous spicy dishes. Inazuma cuisine is quite different, though, as the region actually focuses on making cold cuisines. Thanks to the unique temperature of the food, Chongyun is able to eat as much as he wants without worry.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Diluc</td>
		<td>Diluc keeps a present from Kaeya. It is revealed that after Diluc returned from his four-year journey, Kaeya gave him a vase with his vision inside. The vase is located in Diluc's home and clashes with the rest of his house. The vase is also brought up during the talk between the brothers in Venti's side quest. This is one of the reasons that players can rest assured that Diluc and Kaeya do actually care for one another.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Diona</td>
		<td>Even though Diona likes fish for dinner, she hates everything mixed with vegetables. Many people probably hate vegetables, while Diona doesn’t like any food mixed with vegetables. Aside from fish, it looks like Diona only eats meat.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Eula</td>
		<td>Yanfei, Eula’s Best Friend Besides Amber, Yanfei is the closest person to Eula. After rescuing Yanfei from the Abyss Order attack, Eula becomes very near her. That’s due to the fact Yanfei and Eula have similarities to each other. In addition, Eula can consider Yanfei to do some thing seeking out private facts.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Fischl</td>
		<td>While it's thought to decipher just what type of foods Fischl likes thanks to the strange way she addresses ingredients, Oz does reveal what she hates. Fischl despises Sweet Madame, an obtainable recipe in the world that is a combination of fowl and sweet flower, which makes a healing dish.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Ganyu</td>
		<td>Ganyu is a fellow dog lover and seems to have a connection with all the dogs in the harbor. She has taken it upon herself to name each one of them, although it doesn't seem she can get them to learn their names herself. She is even perplexed by the fact that the dogs will answer to different names.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Gorou</td>
		<td>Gorou works at the yae publishing house</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Hu tao</td>
		<td>Hu Tao has gone farther than most players think with her desire to bury Qiqi - something she believes is the right thing to do since the child is a zombie. In fact, Hu Tao has had poor Qiqi stuffed into a bag several times, only for Dr. Baizhu to stop the kidnapping in the nick of time. Hu Tao has scared Qiqi and is the one person the young girl hates. While Hu Tao now sees Qiqi as a friend, the feeling is not mutual and likely never will be.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Jean</td>
		<td>Jean has a last name, it is Gunnhildr. She is the daughter of Frederica Gunnhildr and Seamus Pegg, the Cardinal of Daybreak. However, her mother separated from her father and took custody of Jean. There's more! She has a sister, Barbara, another playable character and the Deaconess of the Church of Favonius. But while their mother took Jean, their father took Barbara.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Kaedehara Kazuha</td>
		<td>Kazuha isn't incredibly picky with food, but he does have some preferences that may surprise you. Kazuha believes that a dish should never be thrown together in a hurry even when it's something simple like grilled fish. Kazuha thinks that every dish should be carefully prepared, no matter what type of food is being cooked. Every dish he eats should be cooked to perfection in order to get the most out of it.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Kaeya</td>
		<td>Kaeya loves wine, but when it comes to the taste of grape juice, he can't understand how Diluc drinks it. Kaeya feels that great juice is one of the worst drinks ever created and would likely much rather see the grapes that went into the juice be used to make even more alcohol.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Kamisato Ayaka</td>
		<td>Hale's favorite genshin impact character</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Keqing</td>
		<td>It's not surprising that Keqing would like rock music, especially with her forward-thinking views. As it turns out, she is actually a fan of Xinyan. She states that others around her think that the music is noisy, but she thinks that it sounds good and actually enjoys hearing her play.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Klee</td>
		<td>Razor is scared of Klee</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Kujou Sara</td>
		<td>A tengu, Sara is the adopted daughter of the Kujou Clan of the Tenryou Commission. Loyal to both her clan and the Shogun, Kujou Sara carries out her orders to the Shogun's will.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Lisa</td>
		<td>When Lisa was younger, she actually reached the role of grand mage. Even to this day, the title follows her around, but she claims that that isn't who she is anymore. It's safe to say that Lisa is most likely much more powerful than she is putting on and may even be secretly a five-star character.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Mona</td>
		<td>In order to make enough money to survive, Mona accepted a job from the newspaper of Teyvat called The Steambird. She writes a daily astrology column in the paper and can often be found staying up late in order to finish her articles and make enough money to survive.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Ningguang</td>
		<td>Though it may not seem possible, Ningguang was actually quite poor as a child. She started at the bottom and, through sheer hard work, made her way to the top of the trade. This is thanks to a mix of her unwavering attitude and high intelligence that helps her make safe bets. This is likely why Ningguang is still in a down to earth mind-frame that lets her watch after the citizens of Liyue.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Noelle</td>
		<td>One of the stand out accessories that Noelle wears is red roses. This is because she follows the Mondstadt tradition of roses representing secrecy. As a maid of the Knights, she finds herself learning a ton of information that could cause issues if it were to get into the public.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Qiqi</td>
		<td>When Qiqi was brought back to life, her power went out of control, and she went into a rage like state. Because of this, one of the Adeptus decided to seal her inside of a piece of amber in order to stop her from destroying the things around her. She stayed in this state for over one hundred years.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Raiden Shogun</td>
		<td>Ei is the first character who can’t cook in the game Genshin Impact</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Razor</td>
		<td>Lisa was his mentor</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Rosaria</td>
		<td>Despite her love for drinking, Rosaria actually claims that she has never been drunk. There isn't anything that seems to point to her lying about this fact, giving her one of the highest alcohol tolerances in tow</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Sangonomiya Kokomi</td>
		<td>Despite being on the opposite side, Kokomi still respects Kujou Sara. She stated that Sara is not an opponent to take lightly. Kujou Sara is the General of the Tenryou Commission. She is also a Tengu, which is a non-human race adept in both archery and swordsmanship.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Sayu</td>
		<td>Her relationship with Ayaka is a little more strained. Ayaka has taken to asking the shrine maidens to watch Sayu and ensure she isn't slacking off, a fact that Sayu resents.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Shenhe</td>
		<td>She has a homicidal nature</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Sucrose</td>
		<td>Some players won't realize it at first, but Sucrose actually has ears much like Diona. However, she uses a hat to help push her ears down so that they don't stand out. She doesn't really like to bring any attention to herself, and there aren't many feline hybrids walking around Mondstadt.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Tartaglia</td>
		<td>Throughout the entirety of Tartaglia's time in the franchise, his family has been his one true motivation. Having multiple brothers and a sister, the group is constantly mentioned in trailers, voice lines, and quests. Players even get to meet his little brother Teucer in his story quest, during which he works hard to make sure his image is good.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Thoma</td>
		<td>Thoma was born in Mondstadt but is now licing in Inazuma</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Traveller</td>
		<td>A cool detail that most players will likely miss since not many players have more than one Genshin Impact account is the small difference in the twins' constellations. Aether and Lumine have slightly different portraits for their constellations to match their aesthetics. Although their constellations, Viator and Viatrix, have different names and portraits, the way the twins' constellations get upgraded are the same.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Venti</td>
		<td>Even though they are connected to different regions, Venti and Xiao share a very sweet connection. Xiao almost died one night due to his negative karma but was saved by the sound of Venti playing his flute. The song was so calming that it pulled Xiao back to his senses and returned his strength.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Xiangling</td>
		<td>It's no surprise that the company Xiangling keeps would also be pretty determined. Xinyan is one of Xiangling's best friends, and the girls seem to have a strong bond. Xinyan is more than happy to eat anything that Xiangling cooks up and doesn't ever seem to have any adverse side effects from it.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Xiao</td>
		<td>He's 5'2". Despite being one of the most powerful Adepti in Genshin Impact, Xiao isn't exactly blessed with vertical advantage. For some reason, his character model uses that of a teenage male in Genshin Impact, making him the same height as the teenage models.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Xingqiu</td>
		<td>One of the things that Xingqiu is completely horrible at is having legible handwriting. Despite the fact he is an author, Xingqiu has a hard time making his words not look like mysterious symbols. In fact, the Guhua Clan even hides away a passage he wrote because the writing is so atrocious.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Xinyan</td>
		<td>For those who have seen Xinyan's strange idol animation in the level menu, they know about Xinyan's strange phobia. As it turns out, the rocker is incredibly terrified of frogs, despite the fact that there doesn't seem to be any frog monsters walking around Teyvat.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Yanfei</td>
		<td>Yanfei is pretty good with the law, but there are some cases she would just rather not take. Divorce is a sticky battleground that no one truly ever wins in. There is usually no solution that can make both parties happy, and things are even worse for Yanfei when custody comes into play. She feels bad for kids who go through custody battles and wishes that everyone would just meet their soulmate from the beginning.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Yoimiya</td>
		<td>In Genshin Impact, Yoimiya is one of the only characters to have a parental figure in-game. Granted, she is not the first: both Diona and Xiangling have fathers that can be talked to in the game (Draff and Chef Mao respectively). However, Yoimiya would be the first five-star character to have an in-game parental figure. And at that, her family life seems to be very interesting based on their interactions. For one, her father, Naganohara Ryuunosuke, used to run the business before her until his hearing turned for the worst (source of quite a bit of humor from her story quest). Yet, her family has been serious about their craft for generations, each revolutionizing fireworks regardless of their demeanor. It's only this generational love that would allow Yoimiya to take up the shop at such a young age.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Yun Jin</td>
		<td>When it comes to Yun Jin’s singing, fans are eagerly waiting for her operatic version of Hu Tao’s Hilitune. This tune is different in every language, but those using English dub will recognize it as, “Silly-churl, billy-churl, silly-billy Hilichurl…” This expectation comes from Hu Tao’s voice line, where it says that Hu Tao made Yun Jin sing it in opera style after the singer lost a bet. Yun Jin effortlessly gets along with Hu Tao’s eccentricity. She admires Director Hu’s witty remarks, which would make sense considering the two are talented wordsmiths.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Zhongli</td>
		<td>Zhongli has a very noticeable set of amber eyes that match his outfit and hair well. As it turns out, though, those amber eyes are the two things that never change, no matter the form he takes. One can always recognize the eyes of the Geo Archon as they truly stand out. This may be one of the ways that Zhongli ensured his friends could find him when he was in disguise.</td>
